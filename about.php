                                Over the last two decades, a wave of coffee roasters across the globe,
                                known as the Third Wave, redefined ideas about sourcing, roasting and brewing coffee. Abandoning old approaches, these pioneers saw coffee as a natural product with many possibilities, recognising that different varietals, growing conditions, processing methods and brewing techniques could each yield something distinctive in the final cup.
                                <p>
                                    <p>
                                    Inspired by this movement, brothers Steven and Trevor Simmons founded Industry Beans in Melbourne in 2010. Their vision was to roast high-quality specialty coffee in a carefully curated environment of transparency and accessibility, to offer the ultimate coffee experience to their community.
                                <p>

                                    In 2013 they opened the first Industry Beans venue: an all-under-one roof coffee roastery and brew bar in Fitzroy, Melbourne. There, they won over coffee lovers and everyday brunch-goers alike, becoming internationally recognised for their innovative approaches to coffee roasting and commitment to creating unique hospitality experiences.
                                <p>
                                    After ten years, Industry Beans has grown to now roast coffee and operate cafes in Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane.
                                <p>
                                    Every Industry Beans venue is unique to its location and community, and share the same commitment to quality, transparency and accessibility upon which the business was founded.
